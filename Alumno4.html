                When I was younger I saw cartoons as "Courage the 
                Cowardly Dog", "Tom and Jerry", I really liked these 
                cartoons and I think at the present is the same, all 
                from "Cartoon Network", cartoons movies like "The land 
                before time", all cartoons that were funny, they made me 
                happy in those times.

                At the present, I don't see any cartoons, but I remember 
                all those made me happy. Now I only see series and 
                movies that there are on any streaming platform and anime. 
                The cartoons that I saw in the past and the cartoons that 
                are in the present are really different, in the animation, 
                the characters all really changed a lot with the pass the 
                time.

                The technology in the past was the begin the 
                "Smartphones", well I remember that. I had a cellphone on 
                the high school, its camera, the screen, the battery that in 
                these moments were characteristics good for a smartphone. Same 
                case for televisions.

                At the present, the technology has been updated a lot, 
                from smartphones to cars, smartphones with a camera that 
                is the same as a professional camera (in the case where 
                the price of the phones are really expensive), like this 
                case, TV's has a resolution really high as the "8K"  or 
                the cars, they may be electrics they even drive themselves.

                When I was younger, in primary school I logged to 
                Facebook for the teacher to send me homework or 
                advertisements for the school. 
                I remember the interface from Facebook, was simple, 
                to comparison from the present it change a lot of things. 
                Same case to Messenger and all the social platforms

            <p class="pA">
                At present, all social platforms changed very much, from 
                the interface to the form that we use them. 
                For example; Facebook has sections as sales, appointments, 
                groups of many things. In another case, a lot of social 
                apps are not very popular as Twitter(I think that), 
                Slowly, Telegram, and others. 
                But each is useful for something
